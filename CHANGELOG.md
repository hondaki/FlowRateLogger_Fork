* FlowRateLogger.ino
  * Set update interval using a constant UPDATE_INTERVAL 60sec.  
 * Change the screen to show interval e.g. Count/60Sec, flow rate is now mL/60sec, and Total is in L with 5 decimal point number
  * When count overflows ( when diff < 0 ), then add MAX+1 ( Before no +1 )
  * Change the log file's extension to .csv so to open from excel easily
